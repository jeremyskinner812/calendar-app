# <Calendar-App>

## Description

The motivation behind this application was to create a tool to keep track of your daily schedule. I built this to have a site that can be accessed anywhere that saves my tasks online for me to view and track. It solves the problem of a physical calendar that cannot be accessed from anywhere and creating a color-coded, easy to read format for tasks of the day. I learned how to utilize bootstrap and jquery to create a responsive and clean ui for a web application and how to loop using $(this).

After typing in your tasks, click the blue save button on the right of your text. When the page is reloaded, the tasks will still be there.
